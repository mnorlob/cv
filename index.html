                <p><em>Musician, Producer, Tech Guy</em></p>
                <p>I am a musician, producer and lover of technology. I love to play guitar, piano and any other
                    instrument
                    I can
                    get my hands on. I love to write, produce and record my own music as well. You can listen to <a

    Whenever I'm not doing something tech related, working on music or sleeping; you can usually find me outside
    looking for an adventure with my dogs. You can keep up with my personal life by following me on Instagram here!
    --> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/matt_orlob/?hl=en">Matt's Instagram.</a> <br>I am
    a student of
    Management
    Information Systems at Utah State University. The blend between business and technology that I am able to learn
    about through this
    curriculum
    fascinates me. I currently live in Utah and plan to graduate with my BS in late 2019. After which I hope to move
    to
    the Pacific Northwest, find a good job at a good company, and eventually buy a house where I can settle down and
    continue to improve my music and
    tech skills :) Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn! <a
